# my-install-script

This script will quickly install software that I personally like to use on Debian-based Linux machines.
It is not meant to be pretty or provide a lot of user feedback, but rather just gets the job done.

It's still work-in-progress, and I'll comment out or uncomment software as I need it. If you see any use in this, feel free to take it as a starting block and tailor it to your needs.
